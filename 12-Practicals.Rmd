Crash course, basic programming (R), theory about model evaluation etc.

# Practical A {-}
PC-room, supervised exercise

Simple model on diurnal variation in solar angle, radiation extinction and photosynthesis in vegetation types with different and canopy structure and LAI: grassland, broadleaved forest, coniferous forest

Scale: aggregated stand level (big leaf model)

Methodological focus: model formulation: translating a few equations into code

Methodological focus: compiling code, running model, reading input-output

# Practical B {-}

Group work, report, PC room

Modelling diurnal cycle of carbon and water fluxes for flux tower sites (Savannaâ€™s Sahel)

Scale: aggregated stand level

Methodological focus: model-data comparison (goodness-of-fit), simple parameter optimisation

# Practical C {-}

PC-room, supervised exercise

Modelling the size structure of a temperate forest (stand diameter distribution)

Scale: forest stand

Methodological focus: initial conditions

# Practical D {-}

Group work, report, PC room

Modelling carbon stocks (above and belowground) and fluxes

Scale: ecosystem

Methodological focus: Spinup and sensitivity analysis (testing which climate variables have strongest impact on stocks)

# Practical E {-}

PC-room, supervised exercise

Simulating forest succession, meta-analysis of trait dataset to prescribe vegetation functional composition (using PEcAn-framework)

Scale: landscape

Methodological focus: parameter meta-analysis (PFT construction), data assimilation
 
# Practical F {-}

PC-room, group work, microteaching

Climate/land use/management scenario analysis

Scale: site/globe? (Pecan framework) each group choses a question and a model

Methodological focus: sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
