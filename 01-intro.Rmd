# Introduction {#intro}
## Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum: the central role of vegetation 

<!-- UCL chap 2 -->
<!-- Start with a reminder here to insist on the key concept of modelling, i.e. reproducing complex systems with “simple” equations and knowledge gaps: -->
<!-- - the 3 big components and their links, major stocks and fluxes -->
<!-- - different biomes, different behaviors and complexity -->

## Why do we need modelling?
<!-- UCL 2.2 -->
<!-- -context of importance of vegetation modelling in climate change, anthropocene -->
<!-- -Diagnostic models,  -->
<!-- -predictive models,  -->
<!-- -upscaling -->
<!-- -models for data integration -->

## Components of a model
<!-- not in UCL -->
<!-- - model structure  -->
<!-- - parameters -->
<!-- - input/output variables -->
<!-- - state variables -->

## The history of vegetation models
<!-- UCL 4.2.3 -->

### Early history of vegetation modelling
<!-- 1 model for 1 problem + computation limits -->
<!-- - starts with the MIAMI model for NPP -->
<!-- - one-bucket hydrological model -->
<!-- - Lotka-volterra equations for competition -->
<!-- - allometry and forestry -->
<!-- At the beginning all theses models were completely independent from each others and developed by different community working on soil, ecology, atmosphere, etc…, to answer specific questions. Vegetation functioning was not at all at the center -->

### The first DVGMs centered around carbon fluxes
<!-- - When we understood the utility of such models we started to couple each part together (~1980/1990) -->
<!-- - Also correlates with the moment we had enough computing power allowing the coupling. -->

### A new generation of DGVMs centered around vegetation functioning
<!-- All individual models were coupled to create DGVMs centered around carbon fluxes, not vegetation. Now we face new limits because of -->
<!-- 1) The emerging questions with climate change -->
<!-- 2) We realized that vegetation models were not initially developed to simulate vegetation in an integrated manner. -->
<!-- 3) The need for more complexity to simulate acclimation/adaptation -->

## Model types
<!-- -Continuum of empirical to process-based models, temporal and spatial scales -->
<!-- -Types of vegetation models (depending on the purpose, questions, scales) (e.g. timber, yield, biogeochemistry, …), indicating which type of models will be the focus of this course -->
<!-- -Model development cycle (structure for the methodological focus of each application/practical) add fig of Dietze on model-data integration :  -->
<!-- -scales of model: (plant), stand to globe -->
<!-- -focus on this course on natural and managed vegetation (not on crops),  -->
<!-- Potential natural vegetation, climate envelopes -->
